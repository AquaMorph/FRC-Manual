FRC-Manual
==========

A mobile version of the FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC®) Game Manual that follows the Holo Guidelines of Android. This app is a working progress and I am planning on adding more features as time goes on. I would gladly take suggestions for improvements. I am an Alumni and Mentor for FRC® Team 2059 The Hitchhikers and I hope this serves as a useful tool throughout the competition.
